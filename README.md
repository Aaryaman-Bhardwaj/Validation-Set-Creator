Creates validation set from a training dataset(image datasets)

Often in ML challenges and many online datasets contains only training sets. This python script creates a validation set out of the training set by selecting random images from the training set and moving them to a new folder which is named "validation" by default.

After successful execution, a completion message will be printed and a new folder named "validation" will be created in the same directory as the one containing the training images.
